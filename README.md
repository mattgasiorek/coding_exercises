# coding_exercises
Hello visitors!
This repository is going to serve as a place for me to host my projects and exercises.  

My goal is to learn some coding basics and have some fun.

A little bit about me:
I have always enjoyed working in massive data sets and creating useful functions in Microsoft Excel that solve problems for the companies I've worked for. Data-wise, my career has focused on furniture data, corporate governance survey data, and, currently, Medicaid data in North Carolina. 

I've always been interested in coding during my career. For example, during the COVID pandemic, I took up a Google Data Analytics Certificate course. There I learned some of the basics of SQL and R (I did not like R lol). I also took up a tiny bit of Python. In my current role at Trillium Health Resources I still work a ton in Excel, but I've also learned about some new tools like Smartsheet, Power BI, and have been further building my SQL skills.

Currently, I'm interested in learning more about C. I'm not entirely sure how extensive logic function experience in Excel will benefit me here, but it can't hurt!

For anyone who wants to reach out, I'm happy to talk! Especially if you have some coding tips for me lol. I can be reached at matthew.gasiorek.coding@gmail.com. Any feedback is appreciated.
