 * Project Name: Haversine Formula Visualizer
 * Author: Matthew Gasiorek
 * Created On: 2025-05-09
 * Last Modified: 2025-05-09
 * Description: I want this to be a fun, introductory project where I can learn the basics of C and a cool math concept that I learned.
 * The Haversine Formula determines the great-cicle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.asm
 * This is especially important in navigation, where one might want to know the distance between two points on Earth.
 * Version: 1.0
